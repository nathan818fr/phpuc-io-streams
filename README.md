# PHP Utiliy Collections: IO-Streams

An IO streams library for PHP inspired by the Java IO streams API.
Which provide a more convenient way to manipulate byte buffers in PHP.

I make this library for personal projects and tests, it will only contains the
items I need. It will certainly never be completed.

## Installation

This library is published on packagist.org, so you can add it to your composer.json file for an easy installation:
```
composer require nathan818/phpuc-io-streams
```
